            <p>ScientificNotes is a notebook platform, built by researchers, for researchers.</p>
            <p>As researchers, we know how challenging it is to organize large amounts of data while keeping track of
                experiments and notes.</p>
            <p>By integrating the critical aspects of research, storing data and writing notes, we have created a simple yet
                powerful solution that helps you stay organized.</p>
            <p>With ScientificNotes your data files are stored directly with your notes. Using user-defined tagging combined
                with keyword-searching, it has never been easier to navigate through
                your data and notes.</p>
            <!--<p>ScientificNotes comes as a free basic version and as a premium subscription based service.</p>-->
            <p>ScientificNotes is free of charge.</p>
